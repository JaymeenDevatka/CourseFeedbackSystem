📘 Project Title:
Course Feedback System with Sentiment Analysis

📝 Description:
The Course Feedback System with Sentiment Analysis is a Django-based web application that allows students to submit feedback about their courses, while enabling administrators and faculty to analyze this feedback through automatic sentiment detection. The system leverages TextBlob, a natural language processing library in Python, to classify each comment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

It helps colleges and universities understand students' opinions more effectively without manually analyzing thousands of feedback comments.

🎯 Objectives:
Simplify the feedback collection process for courses.

Use AI (Sentiment Analysis) to gain insights from textual feedback.

Provide a clean and interactive dashboard to visualize feedback sentiment.

Allow students to anonymously submit course-related comments.

🔧 Key Features:
✅ Student Side:
Submit feedback anonymously.

Choose the course from a dropdown.

Simple, responsive UI for smooth user experience.

✅ Admin Side:
Add/Edit/Delete course entries via Django Admin.

View all feedback with sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

Graphical sentiment reports using Chart.js for better visualization.

Automatic classification of sentiment using TextBlob (based on polarity).

🧠 Technologies Used:
Tech Stack	Purpose
Django (Python)	Web Framework
SQLite	Default lightweight database
TextBlob	Sentiment analysis on comments
Chart.js	Chart visualization (bar graph)
Bootstrap/CSS	Frontend design & responsiveness
📈 Sentiment Analysis Logic:
Uses TextBlob to analyze the polarity of a comment:

Polarity > 0 → Positive

Polarity < 0 → Negative

Polarity = 0 → Neutral

Sentiment is saved along with each feedback entry in the database.

📊 Visualization:
Feedback sentiments are visualized as a bar chart using Chart.js, giving a quick overview of how students are responding to each course — this helps faculty and coordinators make informed decisions.

💡 Future Enhancements:
Add login system for students and teachers

Track feedback history per student

Export report as PDF

Add word cloud of most used words in feedback

Integrate with email notifications

Deploy on Render, PythonAnywhere, or Heroku
